# Standard vs Advanced Mode

RetrieveIt.AI offers two query modes: **Standard** and **Advanced**. The mode toggle (lightning bolt icon) is next to the send button in Chat.

## Standard Mode (Default)

- **Model**: Claude Haiku - fast and efficient
- **Speed**: Quick responses (typically 2-5 seconds)
- **Best for**: Quick lookups, simple questions, routine queries
- **Usage**: Consumes 1 standard query from your allocation

### When to Use Standard Mode
- Finding specific facts or definitions
- Quick document lookups
- Simple "what is" or "where is" questions
- High-volume daily queries

## Advanced Mode

- **Model**: Claude Sonnet - more capable and nuanced
- **Speed**: Slower responses (typically 5-15 seconds)
- **Best for**: Complex analysis, nuanced questions, synthesis
- **Usage**: Consumes 1 advanced query from your allocation

### When to Use Advanced Mode
- Complex technical questions
- Comparing multiple concepts
- Synthesizing information across documents
- Questions requiring reasoning or analysis
- When standard mode answers seem incomplete

## How to Switch

1. Look for the **lightning bolt icon** next to the send button
2. **Gray** = Standard mode
3. **Amber/Yellow** = Advanced mode
4. Click to toggle between modes

The current mode is also shown below the input: "Standard mode" or "Advanced mode"

## Usage Allocations

Your subscription includes separate allocations for each mode:
- Standard queries: Higher volume (e.g., 800/month per seat)
- Advanced queries: Lower volume (e.g., 80/month per seat)

Check your usage in the Chat interface - the indicator shows remaining queries for your current mode.

## Tips

- Start with Standard mode for most queries
- Switch to Advanced if the answer is unsatisfactory
- Advanced mode is especially useful for "explain" and "compare" questions
- Your allocation resets monthly
