# What Are Workspaces?

Workspaces are containers for organizing your documents in RetrieveIt.AI. Think of them as folders or projects that group related content together.

## Key Concepts

### Organization Structure
- Your **organization** is the top level (tied to your email domain)
- **Workspaces** live inside your organization
- **Documents** are uploaded into workspaces

### Why Use Workspaces?

1. **Organization** - Keep different projects, teams, or topics separate
2. **Access Control** - Control who can search which documents
3. **Focused Search** - Query only the documents relevant to your question

### Examples

- **Engineering Docs** workspace for technical documentation
- **Sales Materials** workspace for pitch decks and case studies
- **HR Policies** workspace for employee handbook and procedures
- **Product Specs** workspace for PRDs and design docs

## Working with Workspaces

### Creating a Workspace
Organization admins can create workspaces from the Dashboard. Click "New Workspace" and give it a name and description.

### Selecting Workspaces in Chat
When you ask a question in Chat, you'll see workspace chips at the top. Click to select which workspaces to search:
- **Green chips** = Your workspaces (you're a member)
- **Blue chips** = Shared workspaces (another workspace granted you access)

You can select multiple workspaces to search across them simultaneously.

### Workspace Roles
- **Workspace Admin** - Can manage members, configure sharing, upload documents
- **Member** - Can search documents in the workspace

## Tips

- Create focused workspaces rather than one large catch-all
- Use descriptive names so teammates know what's inside
- Consider your search patterns when organizing content
