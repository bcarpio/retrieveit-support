# What Does Search Depth Mean?

The **Depth** setting in Chat controls how many document chunks are retrieved when answering your question. It's the number next to the search icon in the input area.

## How It Works

When you ask a question:
1. RetrieveIt searches your selected workspaces for relevant content
2. The **Depth** setting determines how many matching chunks to retrieve
3. These chunks are provided as context to the AI to generate your answer

## Depth Settings

| Depth | Use Case |
|-------|----------|
| **3** | Quick, focused answers from top matches |
| **5** | Default - good balance of speed and coverage |
| **10** | Broader search when topic spans multiple docs |
| **20** | Deep dive when you need comprehensive coverage |
| **30** | Maximum coverage for complex research questions |

## When to Adjust Depth

### Use Lower Depth (3-5) When:
- You want fast responses
- Your question is specific and focused
- You know the answer is in a particular document
- You're doing quick lookups

### Use Higher Depth (10-30) When:
- Your question spans multiple topics
- You need comprehensive answers
- You're researching unfamiliar content
- Initial answers seem incomplete

## Tips

- Start with the default (5) and increase if answers seem incomplete
- Higher depth = more context = potentially better answers, but slower
- Very high depth may include less relevant content that could dilute the answer
- For "summarize everything about X" questions, use higher depth
